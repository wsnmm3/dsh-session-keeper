 * is ordinary Node ESM: the harness loads it through the plugin row, so the
 * dsh packages stay external and are resolved from the running installation
 * rather than bundled.
 *
 * `lib/index.js` keeps the retired `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` name out
 * of its imports (that package no longer exists) and its generated codec
 * entries must carry `create: () =>` factories rather than bare `schema`
 * fields. Both are properties of the source now, not of a patch applied to the
 * emitted file.
